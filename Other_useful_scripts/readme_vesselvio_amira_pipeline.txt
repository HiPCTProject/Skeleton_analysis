These two scripts allow you to turn a vessel vio output into an amira graph. 
Replace the feature_extraction.py in the vesselvio library, with this version. Change line 657 and 667 to be the file path that you want to save to.

Then you can use the matlab code VVToAmira_v3 to write an amira file. Once it is in amira you will need to simplify the graph in the filament editor. 
But it will work!
